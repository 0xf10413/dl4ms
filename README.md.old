A Deep Learning Framework for Motion Synthesis and Editing
==========================================================

About
-----

This is the code and data for the paper of the above title. It consists of a 
large motion database containing several external databases retargetted to 
a single skeleton structure, as well as the code for the paper implemented in 
Theano.

Here is an overview of the structure:

    `data`    - The motion database and data processing scripts
    `motion`  - A helper library for dealing with motion data
    `nn`      - A custom Theano library for neural networks
    `synth`   - Code, examples, and demos used in the paper
    
Quickstart
----------

Once you have installed Theano, Numpy, Scipy, as the network is already trained 
and the data already preprocessed, you can start by running any of the demo 
scripts in the `synth` directory.
